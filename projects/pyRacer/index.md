### Intro

The purpose of this project was to learn a popular programming language not covered in any of my previous semesters. For this project, I was free to choose the programming language and the type of project myself that will demonstrate common practices which includes:

* Variables: declaration, assignment, operators etc.
* Control Structures
* Looping Structures
* Methods, Functions, Classes
* Inheritance
* Use of API libraries

My language of choice was Python since it is one of most popular languages and seems to be quite in demand (Indeed.com, SimplyHired.ca, CareerJet.ca). It is free to learn and IDE's are usually free to use, which gave me an opportunity to use Sublime Text 2. Since I have been already familiar with Java, the learning curve for Python was not too steep since it uses similar principles. This was handy as I had only 2 months to create a basic running demo of this project and had to meet specific criteria.

### The Game

For a chance of pace, I decided to create a racing game to mix things up and to have fun while learning. The racing game has a top-down view that contains 3 opponents and a user controlled car which races on a rounded square designed track. To win, the user must be the first car to successfully complete 5 laps around the racetrack before any of the computer-controlled opponents does first.

This project contains 4 python scripts:

* Main.py
* Classes.py
* Process.py
* screenWrite.py

Along with Python, I used PyGame modules which allows added functionality for graphics, shapes and motion.  Although the the basic prototype was submitted and graded, this project will remain a work in progress.
