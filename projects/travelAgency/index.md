# Summary
This was a project I worked on with two other members which we designed, created and implemented in an Oracle database.  For our project we decided to create a database for a fictional travel agency where you can book flights, hotels and car rentals.  For this project we were required to create:

* Database Schema
* Logical and Relational Diagrams.
* Create a database containing tables with primary key and foreign key constraints, buisness rules
* B-Tree and Bitmap Indexes
* Sequence to generate and insert data for primary keys
* Advanced Queries
  * Natural Join
  * Inner Join
  * Left Outer Join
  * Top-N Query
  * SQL Cursors
  * SQL Triggers
